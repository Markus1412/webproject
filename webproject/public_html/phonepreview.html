                                The user can access this new function by opening the RuterReiser app, then selecting RuterFeedback. 
                                Doing this will take the user to this selection page where you can choose from 7 different vehicles. 
                                You pick whichever vehicle you used/are using and wish to provide feedback for.

                                Select your Metro<br><br>
                                In this example the user selected Metro on the previous screen. 
                                The next step is to pick the correct Metro to make sure you are giving feedback in the proper forum.<br><br>

                                By default the app shows nearby vehicles and lets you select the one you are currently on. 
                                If you are giving feedback after stepping off the Metro you can change the nearby option to recent or history. 
                                The RuterReiser app already has GPS tracking for other functions and will work for RuterFeedback to 
                                ensure you are sent to the forum for the vehicle you were traveling with.<br><br>

                                You also have the option to search for a specific Metro if you can’t find the one you are on/recently used. <br><br>

                                The user does not need to know the specific vehicle-number, just the route. 
                                The specific vehicle number will be worked out through the Ruter database using GPS and your travel history. <br>

                                Feedback Forum<br><br>

                                After selecting your Metro you get sent to the feedback forum for that specific vehicle. 
                                Here you can see current topics and decide to read/reply to them if you wish. You can also 
                                give them a thumbs up/down or use the share button to spread this issue to social media. 
                                The user can sort the current topics by likes, comments or date. <br><br>

                                A user can easily make a new topic by clicking on the “Feedback…” box. 
                                This box will then expand and allow the user to write down their feedback.<br><br> 

                                In this specific example picture the user selected Bus -> Route 32 to get sent to this feedback forum. <br>
