                            Vandalism on public transport does not get the attention it needs. <br><br>
                            There are plenty of vehicles that have obvious flaws, and if it got more attention from the public it would get sorted out faster. <br><br>
                            We think the problem exists partly because notifying Ruter is a hassle, due to an old and outdated system. <br><br>
                            Currently you need to call them to report a problem, and most people would rather not report it at all then. <br><br>
                            It is hard to know how you can report a potential case of vandalism, and 
                            Ruter could do a slightly better job at letting people know how they can help. <br><br>

                            Our proposed solution to the vandalism is to create an extension for the RuterReise application. <br><br>
                            The main objective of this application is to get people to report vandalism, and 
                            it would be important for the application to be easy to use to avoid people getting too annoyed reporting a problem. <br><br>
                            A user could use the feedback function during a ride or within 24 hours after getting off. <br><br>
                            This application should make it easier to report cases of vandalism, especially for younger travelers. <br><br>

                        Since the replies will be available to see for everyone, there is a possibility for spam.
                        To avoid this we would implement a GPS-restriction that would only allow a customer to 
                        give feedback if they are (or were) in the vehicle in the past 24 hours.<br><br>
                        The application might be too technical for older people, 
                        but it would be a non-issue assuming they kept the option to call Ruter. <br><br>

                    <p class="p_text"> 
                        People could automatically get involved/aware by getting a notification once the RuterReise 
                        app has been updated with the Ruterfeedback function. This would be a one-time thing, but 
                        it would make sure people are aware of the new possibilities within the app.<br><br>
                        Having an app like this can generate different statistics that might be valuable for Ruter.<br><br>
                        Because the app is included in the RuterReise app customers would not have to deal with 
                        extra clutter on their phones. Ideally the app-extension would be lightweight. <br><br>
                        The app will work as a base platform for Ruter, and they could expand it easily. <br><br>
                        The app could be expanded to include feedback on drivers/general routes. This could be hidden 
                        feedback to avoid spam and hopefully only generate proper responses.<br><br>

                                                Doing this will take the user to this selection page where you can choose from 7 different vehicles.

                                                This will help the app to be more specific on where to find/write the forum posts of your liking.

                                                In this example the user selected Metro on the previous screen. 
                                                The next step is to pick the correct Metro to make sure you are giving feedback in the proper forum.<br><br>

                                                By default the app shows nearby vehicles and lets you select the one you are currently on. 
                                                If you are giving feedback after stepping off the Metro you can change the nearby option to recent or history. 
                                                The RuterReiser app already has GPS tracking for other functions and will work for RuterFeedback to 
                                                ensure you are sent to the forum for the vehicle you were traveling with.<br><br>

                                                You also have the option to search for a specific Metro if you can’t find the one you are on/recently used. <br><br>

                                                give them a thumbs up/down or use the share button to spread this issue to social media. 
                                                The user can sort the current topics by likes, comments or date. <br><br>

                                                A user can easily make a new topic by clicking on the “Feedback…” box.
